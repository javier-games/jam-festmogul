# The Festmogul

This repository contains the codebase for [The Festmogul](https://javier-games.itch.io/the-festmogul), a worker placement board game where players take on the role of music festival organizers. The code here is designed to simulate and evaluate the gameâ€™s economy, providing a model for resource balancing and game dynamics in a festival-planning setting.

The Festmogul is inspired by the indie music festival scene in Mexico City and was developed during the [Colocando Conciertos Board Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/colocando-conciertos/rate/1465077), associated with the [Primer Turno project](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrimerTurno).

## Download the Game

The Festmogul is available as a physical board game! To experience the full game, including the printed components and complete rules, download it on [itch.io](https://javier-games.itch.io/the-festmogul).

## How to Use This Repository

To explore or modify the economic simulations:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/javier-games/jam-festmogul.git
   ```
2. **Run the Simulations**: Use the scripts to test different game setups and observe how resource adjustments affect gameplay.

## Contributing

Feedback and contributions are welcome! If you have ideas to improve the economic model or add new simulation features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
